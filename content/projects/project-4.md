One of my stupid useless ideas born out of boredom. You give someone a ticket voucher for a kiss or cuddle or whatever, if they accept then lucky for you. If you both failed to give each other your socials, they can scan the ticket's qr code which will redirect them to a page where they can send their contact information.
